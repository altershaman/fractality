# Fractality in the Landscape of Knowledge Representation: A Critical Comparative Analysis

---

## Abstract

This paper situates **Fractality** within the intellectual genealogy of knowledge representation, analogical reasoning, formal ontology, and distributed collaborative systems. We argue that while each predecessor captures a necessary dimension of the problem, none achieves the conjunction Fractality is designed around: the judgment as atomic expression unit, the asymmetric abstraction operator as the sole structural primitive, a self-referential fixed-point root, Person-attributed Bounded Belief corpora, and a conflict model grounded in epistemic plurality.

## 1. Distributional Semantics and the Analogy Benchmark

The distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957) grounds meaning in co-occurrence patterns. Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) demonstrated that directed relational structure is geometrically encoded in embedding space — the classic `king − man + woman ≈ queen` result.

The four-term proportional analogy datasets used to evaluate Word2Vec are structurally related to abstractlang judgments. But the semantic difference is decisive: Word2Vec's relational correspondence is symmetric and approximate. abstractlang's abstraction operator `:` is asymmetric and denotes instantiation — `cat.fur : animal.covering` says the cat-to-fur relation is a concrete case of the animal-to-covering pattern, not merely that they are structurally similar.

| Dimension | Word2Vec | abstractlang |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Operator | Similarity / vector proximity | Abstraction `:` — instantiation |
| Direction | Symmetric | Asymmetric |
| Character | Implicit, approximate | Explicit, exact |
| Attribution | None | Person-attributed (BB) |
| Hierarchy | None | Full judgment DAG |

When two concrete relations share a common abstract parent in a BB — each being a concrete case of the same abstract relation — they are co-instances of the same pattern. This navigable structural fact is what Word2Vec can only approximate as vector proximity.

## 2. Structure Mapping Theory

Dedre Gentner's Structure Mapping Theory (1983) identifies analogy as structural correspondence between higher-order relational patterns. Two domains are analogous when they share relational structure, regardless of surface similarity.

Abstractlang's abstraction operator goes beyond what SMT describes. SMT identifies symmetric structural correspondence — A analogous to B implies B analogous to A. abstractlang's `:` is asymmetric — it encodes that one relation is a concrete instantiation of another, not merely that they share structure. SMT is a cognitive process model; abstractlang is a formal language for storing and distributing instantiation judgments as personal BB corpora.

The concept of co-instantiation — two relations both being concrete cases of the same abstract relation — corresponds to SMT's structural alignment and is a naturally derived navigable fact in any BB DAG.

## 3. Formal Concept Analysis

Formal Concept Analysis (Wille, 1982) derives concept lattices from binary object-attribute relations. The resulting bounded lattice has genuine structural parallels to an abstractlang BB.

Key differences:

| Dimension | FCA | abstractlang |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Atomic unit | Formal concept (derived) | Judgment (cognitive expression) |
| Relation as entity | Not first-class | First-class structural node |
| Structural operator | Set inclusion (derived) | Abstraction operator `:` (expressed) |
| Root | Formal artifact | Self-referential judgment `yin.yang : yin.yang` |
| Person | None — single authority | Each BB = one Person's personal corpus |
| Distribution | Not designed for it | Core via communicative acts |
| Conflict | None | Reflex / negate |

In FCA, directed relations are attributes of objects — not first-class entities. abstractlang makes the directed relation a structural handle that can itself appear as the concrete side of a higher judgment.

FCA has no concept of a Person, a personally held corpus, or epistemic disagreement. It produces a single authoritative lattice. abstractlang produces as many BBs as there are Persons, each personally held, each potentially divergent.

## 4. Semantic Web and OWL

The Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) and OWL provide the richest existing formal infrastructure for knowledge representation.

**On the abstraction operator.** OWL's `subClassOf` encodes set-theoretic inclusion. abstractlang's `:` encodes directed relational instantiation. These are semantically distinct: set inclusion is about membership, instantiation is about pattern realization.

**On relations as entities.** OWL property assertions are not first-class objects. Placing a directed relation in an abstraction hierarchy requires RDF reification. abstractlang makes this the central and only operation.

**On the Person.** OWL assumes central authority. abstractlang is organized around the individual Person's BB. Cognitive acts are Person-attributed. Communicative acts distribute BBs without requiring convergence.

**On conflict.** OWL treats contradictions as reasoning failures. abstractlang encodes disagreement as a first-class state — surfaced during acquire and resolved by the receiving Person.

## 5. Wikipedia

| Dimension | Wikipedia | abstractlang |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Atom | Article | Judgment (`a.b : c.d`) |
| Structural relation | Category membership | Abstraction operator `:` |
| Hierarchy | Shallow, informal | Bounded judgment DAG |
| Person | Suppressed (NPOV) | First-class (BB is personal) |
| Conflict | Editorial consensus | Receiver resolves during join |
| Distribution | Centralized | Communicative acts (share, join, contest) |

Wikipedia's category membership does not encode instantiation. Wikipedia suppresses the individual Person entirely. abstractlang makes the Person — their personal BB, their cognitive acts — the primary unit of organization.

---

## 6. Git

| Git | abstractlang |
|-----|-------------|
| Clone | dispense (full BB copy) |
| Fork | personal BB divergence |
| Merge | acquire (integrate another BB) |
| Merge conflict | conflicting reflex + negate |
| Merger decides | receiver resolves during acquire |
| Commit attribution | judgment author attribution |

The key difference: git merges text — a conflict is answerable by inspection. Fractality acquires judgment corpora — a conflict is a question about whether one relation instantiates another, answerable only by the receiving Person's cognitive judgment.

---

## 7. CRDTs and cr-sqlite

Fractality's judgment set with ±1 signs is a modified 2P-Set CRDT:

```
add_set    = { judgments with sign +1 }   (reflex)
remove_set = { judgments with sign −1 }   (negate)
effective  = add_set \ remove_set
conflict   = add_set ∩ remove_set         → surfaced during join
```

The modification — surfacing rather than collapsing conflicts — is deliberate. Whether one directed relation instantiates another is a judgment that belongs to the Person, not to an automated policy.

## 8. Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form

Spencer-Brown's *Laws of Form* (1969) derives logic from the distinction — the primordial act of drawing a boundary. The re-entry form, where a distinction refers back to itself, generates self-consistency.

abstractlang's root `yin.yang : yin.yang` is a concrete instantiation of this re-entry: the abstraction operator applied to a relation that refers to itself. The judgment lattice folds back on itself at this fixed point — the same judgment form instantiating itself. This is the structural self-similarity the name abstractlang points toward.

## 9. Domain-Driven Design

### Background

Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) organizes software around the domain model. Its central pattern — the **Bounded Context** — defines an explicit boundary within which a particular domain model is internally consistent and a team-agreed **Ubiquitous Language** holds. Different Bounded Contexts may use the same term with different meanings. **Context Maps** describe the relationships between contexts: shared kernel, anti-corruption layer, customer-supplier, and others. DDD rejects a single global domain model in favor of multiple locally coherent ones.

### Relation to abstractlang

The philosophical core is closely aligned. DDD's insight — "the same word means different things in different contexts, stop fighting it" — is structurally identical to abstractlang's: each Person holds their own semantics, no shared universal interpretation.

**Bounded Context ≈ shared BB.** A Bounded Context is a group of Persons whose BBs have converged through consensus into an agreed shared BB. Ubiquitous Language is the stable judgment set within that shared BB — the concepts and relations all Persons in the boundary have collectively reflected and not negated. In Fractality terms, consensus is a public manifest of agreement on a set of judgments — a statement of common truth and an invitation to join.

**Consensus is agreement, not technique.** DDD leaves the process by which a team reaches Ubiquitous Language outside its formal scope — it is a social and organizational practice. abstractlang leaves inter-personal consensus outside its formal scope too — it is tool-dependent, built on communicative acts. Both systems acknowledge the mechanism without formalizing it.

**BB is strictly more general.** DDD addresses only the collective case: a team or subdomain. It has no concept of an individual's bounded semantics. BB covers both: individual Person as the base unit, consensus group as the emergent collective case.

| Dimension | DDD | abstractlang |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Boundary unit | Team / subdomain / software module | Individual Person (or consensus group) |
| Internal structure | Informal — no prescribed formalism | Formal: BB as judgment DAG |
| Bounding criteria | Organizational / business / technical | Epistemic: personality, interest, cognition, global root |
| Shared language | Ubiquitous Language — team-agreed terms | Shared BB — post-consensus judgment set |
| Consensus mechanism | Informal social practice (outside DDD) | Communicative acts — tool-dependent (outside abstractlang) |
| Cross-boundary interaction | Context Maps (ACL, Shared Kernel, etc.) | dispense, acquire |
| Global semantics | Rejected | Rejected |

The remaining gap is formalism and granularity: DDD names organizational forces that bound a context; abstractlang names epistemic forces (personality, interest, cognition, global root). DDD describes how teams should carve up a system; abstractlang describes how Persons constitute and share knowledge — and what happens when they disagree.

## 10. AGM Belief Revision

### Background

The AGM framework (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, Makinson, 1985) is the canonical formal theory of rational belief revision. It defines three operations on a **belief set** K — a logically closed, consistent set of sentences:

- **Expansion** (K + p): add a new belief without removing anything
- **Contraction** (K − p): remove a belief while retaining as much as possible (minimal change)
- **Revision** (K ∗ p): add a belief that may conflict with existing ones; conflicting beliefs are retracted first (Levi Identity: revision = contraction + expansion)

The AGM postulates define rationality constraints — what a belief set must satisfy before and after each operation. Epistemic entrenchment provides an ordering over beliefs that governs which are given up first under contraction.

### Relation to abstractlang

AGM is the closest existing formal theory to abstractlang's cognitive act family. The choice of **Bounded Belief** over Bounded Knowledge for BB is in part a signal of this lineage.

**Operational mapping:**

| AGM | abstractlang |
|-----|-------------|
| Belief set K | BB |
| Expansion (K + p) | reflex |
| Contraction (K − p) | retract (hard delete, recorded in error) |
| Revision (K ∗ p) | reflex of new + negate of conflicting (two separate acts) |
| — | negate (no AGM equivalent) |
| — | reclame (no AGM equivalent) |

The mapping is instructive but breaks on three points.

**Negate is not contraction.** AGM contraction *removes* a belief — it disappears from K. abstractlang's negate *asserts falsity* — it adds a sign −1 judgment, keeping the judgment explicitly in BB as a negated entry. The conflict between a reflexed and a negated judgment is a first-class state, not an inconsistency to be avoided. This is the deepest structural difference.

**Reclame has no AGM analog.** AGM revision is designed as a rational, minimal-change operation — once revised, the prior state is not recoverable through a named act. abstractlang's negate is reversible via reclame. Negation is not a permanent epistemic commitment; it can be undone if the judgment is found true again.

**No logical closure.** AGM's K is deductively closed — it contains all logical consequences of its members. BB contains only explicitly reflected judgments. Inference is an investigative act, external to BB's structure. This makes BB tractable for implementation and distribution in a way that a logically closed belief set is not.

**No epistemic entrenchment.** AGM defines an ordering over beliefs that determines which are given up first under contraction. BB has no such ordering — all judgments are structurally equal. The Person decides what to retract or negate; no policy is encoded.

**Single agent vs. many.** AGM is a theory for a single rational agent. BB is designed for many Persons with communicative acts. The conflict model — same 4-tuple with both signs, surfaced during acquire and resolved by the receiver — has no AGM counterpart. AGM treats inconsistency as a failure to be corrected; abstractlang treats it as a navigable inter-personal state.

## 11. Conclusion

| System | Judgment atom | Abstraction `:` | Self-ref root | Person BB | P2P communicative acts |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Word2Vec | No | No | No | No | No |
| Structure Mapping | Implicit | Correspondence only | No | No | No |
| FCA | Derived | Set inclusion | Trivial | No | No |
| OWL | No | subClassOf | No | No | Partial |
| Wikipedia | No | Membership | No | Suppressed | No |
| Git | No | No | No | Yes (repo) | Yes |
| CRDTs | Arbitrary | No | No | Partial | Yes |
| DDD | No | No | No | Partial (BC) | Partial (Context Maps) |
| AGM | No | No | No | Yes (K) | No |
| **abstractlang** | **Yes** | **Yes (`:`)** | **Yes** | **Yes (BB)** | **Yes** |

No prior system achieves all five simultaneously. Fractality is the attempt to occupy that intersection. DDD comes closest on the organizational axis — its Bounded Context is the collective analog of BB — but operates without formal structure, epistemic bounding criteria, or individual-level semantics. AGM comes closest on the formal belief-revision axis — its belief set K is the single-agent precursor to BB — but is logically closed, single-agent, and has no equivalent to negate, reclame, or inter-personal conflict.
